<h2>Dog Catcher</h2>
<ul>

Help free hamsters out of a laboratory, a mad scientist has taken them away. He wants to use them as subjects for his experiments. You can use a rope to you found in the area to shoot rocks and break their cages, but be careful, time is of the essence because the mad scientist can catch you at anytime
</li>

Strategy game with multiple resources and gesture motions.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>The main tool for the game is the rope, you can attach each end to side of the window, and use it as a slingshot. You can throw rocks and other objects to the hamster’s cages so you can free them. You need to be accurate with the shot because, even tough you can’t hurt the hamsters, time is of the essence and the mad scientist will be back soon.

the mechanic of basic ai, where the dog catcher has a mind of his own.

</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in a laboratory where several hamsters are capture by an evil scientist, and now the only way that they can be free them is by shooting different objects from the outside window with a rope that you just found. You can shoot mostly rocks, but if you see a stapler, testing tubes, Bunsen burner or other lab equipment you can use them to shoot as well.

</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong> The story of the game is that you are an animal liberator that wants to free as many hamsters as possible from a laboratory, and a mad scientist. Unfortunate, you could not find a way inside so you use a window to shoot objects to brake the hamster’s cage and free them.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>The main competitors for Hamster Away are going to be other mobile games such as Candy Crush, or Cut-me-Rope, it will be different in two aspects. It will not be a freemium game, and the user will be able to play offline, and with out the need to pay any extra money. It will also be free of ads, or pop-ups.
